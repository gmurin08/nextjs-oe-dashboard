          As of January 2020, the Internal Revenue Service no longer requires you to file the 1095-B as part of your federal tax return because the tax penalty for failing to meet the individual mandate was eliminated by Congress. Pursuant to the recently passed paperwork reduction act (HR 3797), we will no longer mail the form to you.
